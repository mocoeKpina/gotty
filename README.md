One possible solution is to use a software called Toyota NDCN W55 Navigation DVD Japan 2005-adds 1. This software is a modified version of the original Toyota DVD that adds some features and fixes some bugs. It is compatible with the Toyota NDCN W55 navigation system, which is a 7-inch wide display with DVD-V/CD/MP3/WMA playback and voice guidance. The software contains the latest map data for Japan as of 2005, as well as some extra features such as speed camera alerts, lane assist, and 3D landmarks.
 
The software is not an official product of Toyota, and it is not endorsed or supported by them. It is a fan-made project that was created by some enthusiasts who wanted to improve their navigation system. The software is distributed for free on the internet, but it is not legal to use it without the permission of Toyota. Therefore, you should use it at your own risk and responsibility.
 
To use the software, you need to burn it on a blank DVD-R or DVD+R disc using a software like Nero or ImgBurn. You should give the disc a specific name according to your model, such as 86271-V416A8 for NDDN-W54, 86271-60V450 for NDDN-W58, or 86271-60W250 for NDDN-W56. You should not create any subfolder on the disc, just the LOADING.KWI file that contains the data needed for loading the DVD player. You can download the LOADING.KWI file for your model from [this link] or [this link].

Once you have the disc ready, you need to insert it into your DVD player and wait for it to load. The software will automatically update your navigation system and restart it. You should see a new menu with some options such as Map, Navigation, Settings, and Extras. You can use these options to access the features of the software and customize your preferences. You can also eject the disc and use it again whenever you need to update your system.
 
The software has some advantages over the original Toyota DVD, such as more accurate maps, more detailed information, more user-friendly interface, and more fun extras. However, it also has some disadvantages, such as possible compatibility issues, possible legal issues, possible security risks, and possible warranty voiding. Therefore, you should weigh the pros and cons before deciding to use it.
 
Toyota NDCN W55 Navigation DVD Japan 2005-adds 1 is a software that can enhance your navigation system and make your driving experience more enjoyable. However, it is not an official product of Toyota, and it is not legal to use it without their permission. You should use it at your own risk and responsibility.
